# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive resource teaches students how artificial intelligence operates in the physical world through humanoid robotics.

## About This Book

This textbook provides a progressive learning path from basic concepts to advanced systems in physical AI and humanoid robotics. Each chapter builds upon previous knowledge while providing practical examples using industry-standard tools including ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and Isaac ROS.

## Learning Path

1. **Introduction to Physical AI**: Understanding embodied intelligence and the differences between virtual and physical AI systems
2. **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Core concepts for humanoid robot control and communication
3. **Robot Simulation**: Using Gazebo and Unity for robot development and testing
4. **NVIDIA Isaac**: Advanced simulation and ROS integration with Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
5. **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Combining perception, reasoning, and action in robotics
6. **Conversational Robots**: Humanoid robot interaction and dialogue systems
7. **Capstone Project**: Integrating all concepts in an autonomous humanoid robot

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence](./chapter-1-introduction-physical-ai/embodied-intelligence.md) and progress through each chapter sequentially to build a comprehensive understanding of physical AI concepts and applications.

## Assessment

Use the [Assessment Framework](./assessment-framework.md) to verify your learning outcomes and practical understanding of the concepts covered in each chapter.
