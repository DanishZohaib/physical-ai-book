# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content-First
Educational clarity is more important than tooling. All decisions must prioritize the learning experience and educational value over technical convenience or tooling preferences.

### II. Beginner-Friendly Accuracy
The book must be beginner-friendly but technically accurate. Content should be accessible to newcomers while maintaining technical precision and avoiding oversimplification that leads to misconceptions.

### III. Progressive Learning
Chapters should build progressively from concepts to systems. Each section must build logically on previous knowledge, ensuring a coherent learning path from fundamentals to advanced topics.

### IV. Real-World Robotics Examples
Use real-world robotics examples where possible. Practical applications and case studies should illustrate theoretical concepts, particularly focusing on robotics to demonstrate AI principles in action.

### V. Structured Presentation
Prefer diagrams, structured sections, and summaries. Content must be visually organized with clear headings, visual aids, and summary sections to enhance comprehension and retention.

### VI. University-Level Standards
Content should be suitable for university-level teaching. The material must meet academic standards for rigor, depth, and educational value appropriate for higher education settings.

## Additional Constraints

### Simplicity in Tooling
Avoid unnecessary complexity in tooling and deployment. Technical infrastructure should support content delivery without creating barriers to contribution or maintenance.

### GitHub Pages Deployment
GitHub Pages must be the default deployment target. All technical decisions should support seamless deployment and hosting on GitHub Pages for accessibility and cost-effectiveness.

## Development Workflow

### Content Development Process
Content creation follows a spec-driven approach with clear requirements, architectural planning, and testable tasks. Each chapter must have defined learning objectives and measurable outcomes.

### Review Process
All content must undergo technical accuracy review and pedagogical effectiveness evaluation before acceptance. Changes should be validated by domain experts and teaching professionals where appropriate.

## Governance

This constitution governs all project decisions and supersedes any conflicting practices. Amendments require documentation of rationale and impact assessment. All contributions must align with these principles.
